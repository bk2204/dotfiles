Dagoberto Gilb's work contains significant usage of Spanish, especially when it
provides precision that is not available in English, or it provides humor value.
An example of this is the phrase
.q "\fIburrito sin frijoles\fP\/,"
which not only clarifies that it is really a small donkey he means, and not a
gastronomical creation, but provides the humorous idea that we might have
actually thought he meant the foodstuff.
