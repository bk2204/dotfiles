My overall health status is good.  Almost all of the health risk indicators are
negative for risk.  My body mass index (BMI) is approximately 24, which is
within the healthy range.  My waist circumference is also appropriate.
Furthermore, my percent ideal body weight is 105%, which is also healthy.  The
only potentially objectionable measurement was percent body fat, which was 19.4%
using the Omron, which is slightly above normal range.  However, according to
the caliper measurements, I have 15% body fat, which is within normal
parameters.  Therefore, it appears that I am overall in good health.

The best method for determining health risk is percent body fat.  This is
because it is not affected by extraneous factors such as height and weight, and
instead measures body fat, which in excess is a significant health risk for
illnesses such as diabetes.
