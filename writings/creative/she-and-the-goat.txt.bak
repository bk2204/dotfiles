Deftly manuevering across the endlessness and terrified of her mother, she
realized that she ahad to do something: if she did not, existence itself would
be lost.

The goat, however, was not impressed with this analysis, and told her as much.

"She's your mother," the goat said to her.  "You can't harm her, even if life
itself is at stake."

"Not just life," she siad, "but existence.  The earth won't even exist as a
cold, barren chunk of rock if we don't do something.  I am quite certain you
don't want that."

"Well, no," said the goat, "but isn't there some way we can preserve existence
without doing your mother in?"

"Not without doing you in," she said.

"I withdraw my objections," said the goat.
