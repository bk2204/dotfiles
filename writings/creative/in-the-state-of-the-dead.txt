In the State of the Dead
========================

[verse]
.....
In the state of the dead
	only silence can be heard

Not a soul dares to speakâ€”
	lest the zombie-masters hear.

For if they hear
	chaos will certainly result
as they call out to loved ones still living.

As each one hears the next
	he too remembers,
	crying out in agonizing pain.

For most feared and reviled
	is not torturous Hades
		nay, not even close
	but reminders of those missed and never seen
