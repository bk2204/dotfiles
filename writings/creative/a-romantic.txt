A Romantic
==========

[verse]
.......
I lied.

I _am_ a romantic.
I have been flirting
  with the ultimate.

He has a reputation
  scores have been with him before
  and the separation is like nothing else:
    interminable

Yet
  this time
    I hope it will be forever
    I pray that there will be no long, arduous separation

So I hope
  that I will finally catch his attentions

I long to feel
  his total embrace encompass me
  his firm tool, fibrous, in my hands
  his breath, as life passes from one to the other

For nothing, nought
  is more romantic than he
And I aspire to join my mate
  for eternity.
