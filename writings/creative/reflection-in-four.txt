A Reflection in Four People
===========================

Kody
----

[verse]
......
Life is full of broken dreams
  like a vendor, a huckster
  constantly trying to convince to buy
  buy the hope
    that everything will be fine
    that happiness is acheivable

But it is not fine,
  will not be fine, now or ever
Fine is a lie
  only a promise
    intended to be broken

And happiness is not acheivable
  happiness does not even exist;
  it is but a figment
Still, everyone pretends it
  wishes it
  desires it
  hopes it
  prays it

Fine is only in the end;
  happiness is but a dream
Life is full of those.

Eric
----

[verse]
......
What is it that I desire?

A temptation
  that seeks and asks and looks to destroy me
  that is all my own
    all my own choosing
    all my own fault

A choice
  once made, never undone
  always reminding
  a part of me
    from which I can never escape

Even in death
  it will be with me
  it will be part of me
  unescapable

Yet itself it is escape
  temporary escape
  yet permanently unescapable

A trade
  a bargain, if you will
  buy now, pay later

I pay with my corpse,
  a payment for prolonging
    procrastinating
  a payment for desire

Adam
----

[verse]
......
A quandry
  dilemma,
  self as querent

That which is awful, terrible, unpopular
  for that which is popular
  for exchanging friends
  for not caring, not thinking, death
    but relaxing, living

Popular is not right
  but hard to resist:
  seeping in under the door
Causing temptation, risk, fright
  yet calming, soothing

Unpopular is the same
  yet easier to reject:
  only different in its potential
A distant hope and potential
  is it enough?

Tom
---

[verse]
......
Strangely attractive,
  mysterious
  empowering
  relieving of obligation;

Forcing nothing
  but observation
  knowledge
  insight: enlightenment

Forceful
  self-perpetuating
  a fright of uncertainty
  a dagger, to beat and destroy and murder life

Complicity
  apathy
  indifference:
  a dehumanization of fatality

Relaxing
  reflective
  without and with, at once

In this it is itself
  both together and apart
