Ode on a Sunrise
================

[verse]
......
Crisp, clean air
  calming, soothing
    cooing: don't worry; relax, be
  each breath is another birth
    a renaissance
  an intoxicating scent
  cold to the body
    making it all the warmer to the mind

Sunrise: golden
  streaks of orange and red
  that peek
  through those clouds
    that struggle to hold onto the cool night

Yet it will not last beyond this:
  a melding of the new and the old
    the past and the future
  into some ineffable slurry of here and now
    thin waters of darkness with
    passionate balls of light

Shining onto the shadowed trees
  daring to illuminate
  dappling
  slowly, steathily absorbing
    dispelling the shady blues, grays, and greens
    changing to rich, vibrant tones

Tones of the unknowable
  seizing that which was
  transforming it into the present.
