Battle of the Sky
=================

[verse]
......
As the Sun glances longingly
	over the horizon
	the Night grows.

Sun peeks out
	straining
	as the night plans its siege.

When Sun least expects it,
	Night draws forth and seizes victory.

Sun fails to struggle further,
	the stadium empties of Colors
and coolness sets in

Soon, Sun will be back to fight again
	and winâ€”but for now
Night reigns
