[verse]
......
We don't exist
	the boys you can fix aren't real
		aren't broken.
We need fixing
	but it comes not easily
All the love in the world
	could not fix us;
	our thoughts, minds, hearts
		remain broken
		until we love ourselves,
cleanse our souls
	of the self-junkyard
	full of the half-working and discarded
