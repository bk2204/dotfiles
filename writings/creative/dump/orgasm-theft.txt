Orgasm Theft
============

Nobody openly opposed the new law because nobody wanted to be seen on record as
licentious.  Secretly, though, almost nobody supported the new law; after all,
sex should be a private matter, and the orgasm is the point of sex.

The "Climactic Control" movement had contributed significant amounts of money to
the re-election campaigns of almost all the senators and congressmen.  A little
blackmail never hurt, either.  It was pretty obvious that Climactic Control was
a coalition of mostly large corporations and evangelicals.  The former wanted
money and the latter, well, they just thought it was a great way to prevent sex.

The law, Creating Ubiquitous and Manageable Sexual Health through Orgasm Tolls
(CUM-SHOT), took effect on September 1, 2037.
