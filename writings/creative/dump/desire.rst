What is it that I desire?
What is this temptation that seeks and asks and looks to destroy me, yet is all
my own, all my own choosing, all my own fault?
Why have I chosen this, what does this mean, who am I, is there an I anymore?
Is destruction the natural manner of things, is it the natural manner of me?
Is asking questions relevant, does it mean anything, do questions have value
without answers, are questions valuable only because they lead to thoughts that
lead to answers and solutions?
Can anything be valuable in itself, or do things only have value because they
lead to other things?  how are combinations of things valuable when their
components are not?  Is anything valuable?  Does anything matter?
Do ethics matter?  Or should we only seek passion, pleasure, desire?  What is it
that I desire?
