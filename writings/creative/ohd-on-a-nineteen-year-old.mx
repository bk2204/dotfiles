I wonder, why I am consumed with you
for so few days have we known each other,
but still it seems like an eternity;
and voidness without.

A tendril breaks through the surface
to seek your sunny rays, warm glow;
but still, too, you provide a coolness,
even drenching rain.

And so I find myself in a place
that I have not known before
yet still I wish to spelunk deeper
into your depths.
