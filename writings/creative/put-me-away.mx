They're going to put me away, I know it.  After this last time, there's no
doubt.  I screamed at Mrs. Timms again, and this time it was so bad she cried
and ran out of the room.  I don't know why I do it.  I just can't help it: when
it starts, it just flows out and I can't stop it.

The littlest things set me off these days, and even the medication they gave me
isn't helping.  Dr. Bryant
