Dear John,
.P
My relationship with writing has grown from love-hate to that of a friend.
We still are discovering things about one another, though, and I don't know if
we will ever be good friends, let alone best friends.
.P
In fact, that is what I fear the most about this class: that it will not help
foster and fuel this relationship, but instead teach me nothing useful.  Not
that the class itself would not be useful, but that I would not have the ability
to partake of it properly.  Still, I hope exactly the opposite: that I will be
propelled to new heights with writing, and that I can perceive new ideas,
thoughts, and concepts more clearly and easily.
.P
When in high school, I disliked writing immensely: the cold analysis of books
written by those who are by now surely zombies just wasn't my thing.  I only
enjoyed writing about things that intensely interested me, and even then I
wasn't very good at it.  Now, though, I find I have things to say.
.P
I think this started in my second semester of college: I found I liked writing
about political matters and controversial subjects; that's not odd, since I
really enjoy arguing and debating and always have.  I found that although the
International Baccalaureate Organization did not care about controversy, I did,
and my writing reflected it.  In fact, nowadays, I enjoy writing so much that I
even sometimes become frustrated at the lack of speed with which I can handwrite
and type.
.P
Surely, one of the most annoying parts of writing for me is speed: my poor
object manipulation makes handwriting either painfully slow or completely
illegible.  Thus, most of my writing at present is either short stories, or more
commonly, poetry.  I write the occasional technical document, too.
.P
My writing is influenced much by my life as a gay bipolar male; my
reading of philosophical treatises like the
.I "Tao Te Ching" ,
.I "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Madness" ,
and
.I "G\(:odel, Escher, Bach" ;
my insane and odd desire for precision; and my love of computers, among other
things.  A good cup of Earl Grey doesn't hurt either.
.P
I certainly hope you found this letter useful, or at least worthy of your time.
.FC Best,
.SG
