A quandry
  dilemma,
  self as querent

That which is awful, terrible, unpopular
  for that which is popular
  for exchanging friends
  for not caring, not thinking, death
    but relaxing, living

Popular is not right
  but hard to resist:
  seeping in under the door
Causing temptation, risk, fright
  yet calming, soothing

Unpopular is the same
  yet easier to reject:
  only different in its potential
A distant hope and potential
  is it enough?
