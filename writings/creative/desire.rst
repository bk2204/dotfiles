What is it that I desire?

A temptation
  that seeks and asks and looks to destroy me
  that is all my own
    all my own choosing
    all my own fault

A choice
  once made, never undone
  always reminding
  a part of me
    from which I can never escape

Even in death
  it will be with me
  it will be part of me
  unescapable

Yet itself it is escape
  temporary escape
  yet permanently unescapable

A trade
  a bargain, if you will
  buy now, pay later

I pay with my corpse,
  a payment for prolonging
    procrastinating
  a payment for desire
