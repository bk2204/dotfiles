I have this Bohemian fantasy.

Every time I look at my friends, and think about the space we don't have
in our crowded apartments, or the crappy, low-earning jobs we do have, or the
dives we hang out in, I am somehow relaxed.  As odd as it is, I think it
reflects our cultural values: that money is not as important as most people make
it out to be.  I am certain that each of us could make significantly more money
if we wanted to, enough to each own a house.  But instead, we prize something
else, something quite ineffable, yet easy to discover.  We desire to get by, but
not to excel.

Or rather, not to excel in having lots of money.  We excel in making do with
what we do have, in loving, in fighting, in La Vie Boheme.  We excel in being
true to ourselves, in wishing, in hoping.  We excel in all that we are, and all
that we might be, one day, just maybe.

We keep alive that hope that allows us to continue.
