Life is full of broken dreams
  like a vendor, a huckster
  constantly trying to convince to buy
  buy the hope
    that everything will be fine
    that happiness is acheivable

But it is not fine,
  will not be fine, now or ever
Fine is a lie
  only a promise
    intended to be broken

And happiness is not acheivable
  happiness does not even exist;
  it is but a figment
Still, everyone pretends it
  wishes it
  desires it
  hopes it
  prays it

Fine is only in the end;
  happiness is but a dream
Life is full of those.
