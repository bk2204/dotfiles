Nightmare
=========

Daytime.
Standing in the street, joking.

There’s a traffic jam, and suddenly, an accident.  Two people trying to get into
a third person’s lane; it forms an arrow.  I hear screaming, far off, then
closer.

I look over: a man comes with a long-range rifle and bends down in front of the
car, the one that forms the stem of the arrow.

I grab Scott and Nick and throw them to the ground.  I lie atop Scott,
partially.  He struggles; I don’t think he knows what’s going on.  “Chill,” I
hiss.  Nick gets it; he must have seen the man. He doesn’t move.

Gun blasts; they’re loud, but they’re presumably hitting the driver, because
they’re not close enough to be hitting us.

I hear footsteps as the man turns the corner.  He fires at Scott, who is still
moving.  My ears ring.  Instantly, I feel the blood and guts shower me.  I
freeze completely still, hoping he’ll think me collateral damage.  I try not to
breathe in the blood; there’s so much of it that I know Scott’s dead.

Then another shot.  I know I’m not hit, as I am covered in more blood and more
guts—there’s no pain.  Something wet lands on the small of my back, my shirt
sticks to me, as I hear the man walk away.

I dare to raise my head. I don’t have much of a choice: there’s so much blood,
and I’m trying not to breathe it in.
