Strangely attractive,
  mysterious
  empowering
  relieving of obligation;

Forcing nothing
  but observation
  knowledge
  insight: enlightenment

Forceful
  self-perpetuating
  a fright of uncertainty
  a dagger, to beat and destroy and murder life

Complicity
  apathy
  indifference:
  a dehumanization of fatality

Relaxing
  reflective
  without and with, at once

In this it is itself
  both together and apart
