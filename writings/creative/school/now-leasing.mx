Now leasing,
	proclaims the building.
Come and live in me.

Love the warm sun shining through my windows.
Embrace the beautiful sights.
Enjoy my climate control.

Reflect on my stylish architecture.
Look at my new fixtures.
Enjoy my climate control.

Marvel at my arched entryways.
Gaze at my marble floors.
But please, enjoy my climate control.
