I don't want people to shout my name
I want them to whisper it.

Shouts are loud, raucous; hurting ears.
Yet everyone strains to hear the whispers
of secrets and sweet nothings.

Any fool can scream from a mountaintop,
but \c
.q "your softest singing is your best singing"
and I want to be someone who tried his best.
