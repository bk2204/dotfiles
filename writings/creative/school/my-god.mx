My god is a peaceful god
	warming hilltops
	and cooling rivers.

My god is a humble god
	realizing potentials
	and stoking fires.

My god is a thankful god
	asking questions
	and listening for answers.

My god is an honest god
	begging thoughts
	and fostering expressions.

My god is a caring god
	wanting hopes
	and fulfilling dreams.
