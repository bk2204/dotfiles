In a vast chasm
	full of rushing winds
	sits gently moving cattails
	swaying back and forth

I like to think that they're trying to tell us something
	``sit back,
	relax.
	Worry less,
	be more.''

It seems to work for them
	not worrying if the field mice
	dash and dance about
but just soaking up the sun, the air
	and letting things be as they may
	real and carefree.
