He looks down on himself
from on top of thunderclouds,
a precision timepiece gone wrong:
	tick, tick, boom?

He flies through the air
with feet on fire:
	a burning Mercury, falling.

He sees everything sharper, clearer
	yet out of focus, off kilter:
	his stability marred by excess.

He feels the cool breeze; yet
	it burns, scorches with desire.

He rests himself, soon to be living once more.
